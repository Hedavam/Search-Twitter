# Important Update
> Due to significant policy changes following Twitter's acquisition, we no longer have access to the new Twitter API. As a result, the **Search Twitter** app project has been discontinued. We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.


# Search Twitter

## Usage:
To use the app (while it was operational), simply enter a Twitter username (without the '@' symbol). The app would then process the input and generate detailed visuals and analytics.

## Limitations:
The analysis was limited to a maximum of 3,200 tweets per user, which may affect the comprehensiveness of insights for less active accounts.
